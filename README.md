## Introduction

This program is a classic "Hello, World!" example, which is often used to introduce programmers to a new language. It demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program and outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Features

*   Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
*   A simple and clean implementation to illustrate fundamental C++ concepts.

## Requirements

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
*   A basic understanding of the command line

## Installation

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source file (e.g., `hello_world.cpp`).
3.  Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
```

4.  Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./hello_world
```

## Usage

When you run the program, it will display:

```text
Hello, World!
```

## How It Works

The program includes the `iostream` header for input/output operations. It uses the `std::cout` stream to print the message to the console.

Here's the simple C++ source code (assuming it's in `hello_world.cpp`):

```cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
